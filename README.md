Android App that helps learning for the referee bill (C- and D-license)

# Introduction
I have published the App 2016 to the App store. 

I started developing the App because I needed a referee bill and it was very helpful to learn with the app. There is still no app in the app store with the same task.

But I never had time to update the app.

That's why I'm now publishing the code.

Please contact me if you want to contribute..
